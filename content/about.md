## My name's Amey. 

I'm a Senior Year CSE student experimenting with Python and Go. I'm interested in Data Science, Machine Learning and making Open Source Software. You can see my resume [here](/resume.pdf).

I also like to write about things that I learn, am passionate about or find compelling enough to writing about. Check out what I've written so far on my [blog](/posts).
